---
#### **File: `Witness Pattern with Phantom Types.move`**

This Move file provides a concrete implementation of the "Witness Pattern," a powerful security and authorization mechanism that uses phantom types to prove authorization at compile time.

**Module Structure and Concepts:**

*   **`registry` Module:**
    *   **`RegistryWitness<phantom T>`:** An empty struct that acts as a "proof" or "witness" that the holder is authorized to perform operations related to type `T`.
    *   **`create_witness<T>()`:** The core security function. Only the module that defines type `T` can create a witness for it.
    *   **`register_type<T>(..., _witness: RegistryWitness<T>)`:** A function that requires the caller to provide a `RegistryWitness<T>`, proving they have the authority to register the type.
    *   **`SecureResource<phantom T>`:** A generic resource whose creation is gated by the witness pattern.
*   **`example_types` Module:** A practical example showing how to define a custom type and use a witness to register it and create a secure resource.

**Overall Purpose:** This file is an excellent, self-contained demonstration of how phantom types can enforce module-level permissions at compile time, creating a non-forgeable, zero-cost capability token.

---
#### **File: `Capability-Based Access Control.move`**

This Move file demonstrates a sophisticated Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system built using phantom types. It defines a generic `Capability` token that can be specialized for different permission levels.

**Module Structure and Concepts:**

*   **Permission Types:** Defines empty structs (`ReadPermission`, `WritePermission`, `AdminPermission`) to act as phantom type markers for different roles.
*   **`Capability<phantom Permission>` struct:** The core of the system. A `Capability<ReadPermission>` is a distinct type from a `Capability<WritePermission>`. The struct also contains data like `expires_at` for time-based permissions.
*   **`ProtectedResource<phantom Permission>` struct:** A generic resource that requires a matching `Capability` token to be created or interacted with.
*   **Capability Inheritance:** Cleverly implements permission inheritance where an `AdminPermission` capability can be used to generate `ReadPermission` or `WritePermission` capabilities.
*   **Testing:** A comprehensive test demonstrates the entire workflow, including granting, checking, and using capabilities.

**Overall Purpose:** This file provides a practical example of building a flexible and secure access control system in Move, moving permission checks from runtime to the type system itself for better safety and gas efficiency.

---
#### **File: `Advanced Type-Level Programming.move`**

This Move file is a fascinating exploration of using the Move type system itself to perform computations and enforce complex invariants at compile time, all using phantom types.

**Key Concepts and Patterns Demonstrated:**

*   **Type-Level Data Structures:** Defines structs representing data at the type level, such as booleans (`True`, `False`) and natural numbers using Peano encoding (`Zero`, `Succ<N>`).
*   **`SizedVector<phantom N>`:** A vector that encodes its size `N` into its type, allowing for compile-time size checking.
*   **`StateMachine<phantom State>`:** Uses phantom types to enforce valid state transitions (e.g., `Uninitialized` -> `Active` -> `Suspended`). Invalid transitions cause a compile-time error.
*   **`Matrix<phantom Rows, phantom Cols>`:** Encodes matrix dimensions into the type system to prevent dimension mismatch errors during operations like multiplication at compile time.
*   **Proof Tokens:** Introduces `Proof<P>` tokens that can only be constructed if a certain type-level property is true, enabling a form of dependent types.

**Overall Purpose:** This file showcases the extreme capabilities of the Move type system for high-assurance programming, demonstrating how to offload complex logic and validation from runtime to compile-time checking.

**Key Points Covered:**

*   **`simple_map`:** Notes that one must check for a key's existence before access.
*   **Fungible Assets & Objects:** Clarifies that an account can hold multiple objects of the same FA type.
*   **Object Model:** Summarizes that objects are transferable, can be nested, and that the `ConstructorRef` is an ephemeral capability used to generate other permissions.
*   **Function Visibility:** Differentiates between `public` and `public entry` functions.

**Overall Purpose:** A classic developer's cheat sheet, reflecting a solid grasp of key Aptos Move concepts.

---
## Directory: `codes/AccountBalance/`
---

#### **File: `Move.toml`**
*   **Package Name:** `AccountBalance`
*   **Dependencies:** Standard dependency on `AptosFramework`.

#### **File: `Note.md`**
*   Contains a single note: `"Not able to see the debug logs"`, likely related to the developer's experience running the script.

#### **File: `scripts/ReadBalance.move`**
*   **Logic:** A simple script that takes the signer's account, gets their address, calls `coin::balance<aptos_coin::AptosCoin>()` to retrieve the native coin balance, and prints it using `std::debug::print`.
*   **Purpose:** A straightforward educational example of how to read an account's balance.

---
## Directory: `codes/Composed-Transaction/`
---

This project demonstrates how to compose multiple, independent modules together in a single atomic transaction. It combines a fungible token (`FirstCoin`), an NFT module, and a `Vault` module.

#### **File: `Move.toml`**
*   **Package Name:** `Composed Transaction`
*   **Dependencies:** `AptosFramework` and `AptosTokenObjects`.

#### **File: `sources/FirstCoin.move`**
*   A simple fungible token (`FST`) using the `managed_coin` standard.

#### **File: `sources/NFT.move`**
*   Provides functionality for creating an NFT collection and minting NFTs into it using the `AptosTokenObjects` standard.

#### **File: `sources/Vault.move`**
*   Allows users to create a personal vault to deposit and withdraw the `FirstCoin`.

#### **File: `scripts/Composed-Transaction.move`**
*   **Purpose:** The key file that ties the project together. It's a script that executes a series of actions in a single transaction: it deposits `FirstCoin` into the vault and then mints an NFT as a "reward." This perfectly illustrates the concept of composability in Move.

---
## Directory: `codes/Counter/`
---

A beginner-level project implementing a simple, on-chain counter stored as a resource under each user's account.

#### **File: `Move.toml`**
*   **Package Name:** `Counter`
*   **Dependencies:** `AptosFramework`.

#### **File: `sources/Counter.move`**
*   **Resource:** `struct Counter has key { counter: u64 }`.
*   **Events:** Well-instrumented with `CounterInitialized`, `CounterIncremented`, and `CounterDecremented` events.
*   **Functions:** Provides `create_counter`, `increment`, `decrement`, and a `get_counter` view function. Includes a test to verify the logic.
*   **Purpose:** A classic "Hello, World!" style example for smart contracts, teaching the fundamentals of Move resources.

---
## Directory: `codes/FirstCoin/`
---

This project demonstrates two different ways to create a fungible token: a high-level managed approach and a lower-level "raw" approach.

#### **File: `Move.toml`**
*   **Package Name:** `FirstCoin`
*   **Dependencies:** `AptosFramework`.

#### **File: `sources/FirstCoin.move`**
*   Implements a token using the high-level `managed_coin` module. The `managed_coin::initialize` function abstracts away all the details of capability management.

#### **File: `sources/FirstCoinRaw.move`**
*   Implements a token using the lower-level `coin` module. This approach requires explicit management of the `MintCapability` and `BurnCapability`, which are stored in a custom `Capabilities` resource. This makes access control more explicit and demonstrates how to transfer ownership of the token supply.

**Overall Purpose:** An excellent comparative study contrasting the "easy mode" (`managed_coin`) with the "pro mode" (`coin`) of creating tokens.

---
## Directory: `codes/HelloMove/`
---

A foundational "Hello, World!" example, designed as a developer's first introduction to creating a Move module.

#### **File: `Move.toml`**
*   **Package Name:** `hello_move`
*   **Dependencies:** `AptosFramework`.

#### **File: `sources/HelloMove.move`**
*   **Resource:** `struct Message has key { msg: vector<u8> }`.
*   **Functions:** Provides `set_message` and `get_message` functions. A key detail is that it hardcodes the storage address to the module publisher's address, meaning it always modifies a single, global message.
*   **Purpose:** A perfect first step for a new Move developer, introducing modules, resources, storage operations, events, and testing in a simple context.

---
## Directory: `codes/MTK/`
---

This project implements a "Permissioned Token Minting System" using a capability-based pattern with phantom types.

#### **File: `README.md`**
*   Clearly outlines the requirements: create a `MintCap<phantom T>` to control minting for different token types `T`, and allow an admin to delegate this capability.

#### **File: `sources/MyToken.move`**
*   **Capability Structs:** Defines `MintCap<phantom CurrencyType>`, `BurnCap`, etc., as empty resources that act as proof of permission.
*   **Core Logic:** A `deploy<T>` function creates a new fungible asset `T` and gives the `MintCap<T>` to the admin. The `mint<T>` function requires the caller to hold the `MintCap<T>`. The admin can delegate this capability by creating a new `MintCap<T>` and moving it to another account, and can also revoke it.
*   **Purpose:** An excellent, advanced example of a capability-based system using phantom types for secure, flexible, and extensible management of permissioned tokens.

---
## Directory: `codes/NFT/`
---

A straightforward example of how to create and mint an NFT using the modern `AptosTokenObjects` standard.

#### **File: `Move.toml`**
*   **Dependencies:** `AptosFramework` and `AptosTokenObjects`.

#### **File: `sources/NFT.move`**
*   **Functionality:** Demonstrates the two primary steps of the NFT process:
    1.  `init_module` calls `collection::create_fixed_collection` to create a collection.
    2.  `mint_nft` calls `token::create_named_token` to mint an individual NFT into that collection.
*   **Purpose:** A clear and concise introduction to the standard, high-level workflow for integrating NFTs in Aptos.

---
## Directory: `codes/RBAC/`
---

This project implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system using phantom types to encode user roles into the type system.

#### **File: `README.md`**
*   Sets the design challenge: build an RBAC system using `Role<phantom T>` where `T` is a role marker type.

#### **File: `sources/RBAC.move`**
*   **Role Types:** Defines empty structs `Admin`, `Moderator`, `User` as role markers.
*   **Core Struct:** `struct Role<phantom T> has key {}`. An account's role is determined by the existence of this resource under their address (e.g., holding `Role<Admin>` makes you an admin).
*   **Functionality:** An admin can `assign_role<T>` to other users. Functions can then use `only_role<T>` as a permission check, which asserts the signer holds the required role resource.
*   **Purpose:** A concise and elegant demonstration of a capability-based RBAC system that is both secure and gas-efficient due to its reliance on compile-time type checking.

---
## Directory: `codes/Resource-Account-Deployer/`
---

An advanced exercise demonstrating how to use a **Resource Account** to own and manage a smart contract module.

#### **File: `module.sh`**
*   **Purpose:** The key to the project. It shows the CLI commands to first derive the future address of a resource account, and then use `aptos move create-resource-account-and-publish-package` to both create the account and deploy the module from it in one step.

#### **File: `sources/NFT.move`**
*   **Module:** `my_addrx::NFT` (where `my_addrx` is the resource account's address).
*   **Core Logic:** The `init_module` function retrieves the `SignerCapability` for the resource account and stores it. The `mint_nft` function then uses this stored capability to generate a signer for the resource account, meaning the **resource account itself is the creator of the NFT**, not the user who called the function.
*   **Purpose:** A superb demonstration of on-chain autonomy, separating a contract's identity and authority from any external user, which is a cornerstone of building decentralized applications.

---
## Directory: `codes/Supra-Task-1/`
---

This project implements a whitelisted vault system using the `SupraFramework`.

#### **Files: `FA.move` and `Vault.move`**
*   **Functionality:** Together, these modules create a system where an admin can whitelist addresses that are allowed to deposit a specific Fungible Asset into a central vault. The vault itself is a resource account, ensuring the funds are held securely by the contract.
*   **Purpose:** A comprehensive, real-world example of a permissioned DeFi application on the Supra blockchain, combining Fungible Assets, resource accounts, and whitelist-based access control.

---
## Directory: `codes/Supra-Task-2/`
---

This project implements a sophisticated and unique loyalty rewards system with expiring tokens, built on `SupraFramework`.

#### **File: `sources/FA.move`**
*   **Core Concept:** Instead of giving users tokens directly, the admin mints "token objects." Each object represents a claim on a certain amount of a fungible asset and has its own expiry date. A user's balance is the sum of their non-expired token objects.
*   **Claim Logic:** The `claim_amount` function iterates through a user's token objects, discards expired ones, and "spends" the underlying fungible asset from the non-expired ones.
*   **Purpose:** A highly advanced and creative example of smart contract design, using the object model to solve the complex business problem of expiring loyalty points or vested tokens.

---
## Directory: `codes/Supra-Task-3/`
---

This project focuses on the operational and governance aspects of deploying the loyalty rewards module from `Supra-Task-2` using a multisig account.

#### **File: `supra-multisig-setup.sh`**
*   **Purpose:** The centerpiece of the project. A comprehensive, interactive Bash script that automates the entire multisig workflow on the Supra testnet, from creating accounts to funding them, creating the multisig wallet, and deploying/interacting with the module via multisig proposals.
*   **Purpose:** A masterclass in smart contract governance and operations, providing a practical guide and reusable template for using the `supra` CLI for multisig management.

---
## Directory: `codes/Task-1-Whitelisting/`
---

This project is the Aptos-based counterpart to `Supra-Task-1`, implementing an identical whitelisted vault system using the standard `AptosFramework`.

#### **Files: `FA.move` and `Vault.move`**
*   **Functionality:** The logic is identical to the Supra version, demonstrating the portability of the design pattern. It uses a resource account as a treasury and a `SimpleMap` to manage a whitelist for deposits and withdrawals.
*   **Purpose:** A well-structured reference implementation for a permissioned DeFi application on Aptos.

---
## Directory: `codes/Task-2-Loyalty-Reward/`
---

This project is the Aptos-based counterpart to `Supra-Task-2`, implementing the same sophisticated loyalty rewards system with expiring tokens using the `AptosFramework`.

#### **File: `sources/FA.move`**
*   **Functionality:** A direct port of the logic from the Supra version. It uses a central `Object` as a `TokenStore` and creates individual, expiring `TokenObject`s for each reward grant.
*   **Purpose:** A powerful demonstration of how to build complex, object-oriented applications in Move on Aptos, highlighting that advanced patterns are fundamental to the Move object model itself.

---
## Directory: `codes/Task-3-Loyalty-Reward-With-Multisig/`
---

This project is the Aptos-based counterpart to `Supra-Task-3`, focusing on deploying the loyalty rewards module from `Task-2` using an Aptos multisig account.

#### **Files: `README.md` and `TESTNET.sh`**
*   **Purpose:** The `README.md` provides a raw list of `aptos` CLI commands, while `TESTNET.sh` is a more robust and user-friendly interactive script that automates the entire process.
*   **Functionality:** The script handles creating profiles, funding accounts, creating a 2-of-3 multisig wallet, and deploying/interacting with the loyalty module via multisig proposals. It dynamically fetches sequence numbers, making it more reliable.
*   **Purpose:** An excellent, practical tutorial and reusable template for implementing multisig governance for any Aptos project.
