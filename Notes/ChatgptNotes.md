# 1. Basics & syntax (Tag: **Beginner → Intermediate**)

**Goal:** Give you the minimal working knowledge to read, write and compile simple Move modules and scripts on Aptos.

### Beginner explanation (conceptual)

Move is a Rust-like, resource-oriented smart-contract language designed to express and protect assets. Programs are packaged as **modules** (persistent libraries) and **scripts** (transaction entrypoints). Move enforces linear/resource semantics (resources cannot be copied or implicitly dropped) which reduces many classes of asset bugs. Aptos uses Move (Move _2_ in modern toolchains) and runs Move programs via the Move VM. ([aptos.dev][1])

### Intermediate detail (rules, syntax, examples)

- **File structure:** Move packages use `Move.toml`, `sources/` with `.move` files.
- **Module skeleton:**

```move
address 0x1 {
  module Hello {
    public fun greet() {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

- **Script skeleton:**

```move
script {
  use std::signer;
  fun main(caller: &signer) {
    // entrypoint
  }
}
```

- **Visibility:** `public` functions in modules are callable by other modules; `public entry` (i.e., `public(script)`) defines transaction entrypoints. Use `acquires<Type>()` to state the resource types a function may access in global storage. (See `acquires` further in Storage patterns section). ([aptos.dev][2])

- **Compilation & run (CLI):**

  - `aptos move compile` — compile the package (creates `build/` artifacts).
  - `aptos move run-script --script-path sources/my_script.move` — compile + run a script (or use separate `compile` then `run-script` steps). For packages with named addresses, pass `--named-addresses`. ([aptos.dev][3])

### Advanced notes / common pitfalls / design patterns

- **Named addresses & tests:** Many examples use `0x1`, `0xA` etc. Use `Move.toml` `named_addresses` or pass CLI `--named-addresses`. Failing to set named addresses is a common compile error.
- **acquires vs global ops:** Omitting `acquires<T>` on a function that does `move_from<T>` will cause compile-time errors. Always annotate.
- **Prefer modules for reusable logic** and scripts for ad-hoc transactions; avoid putting business logic only in scripts (harder to reuse and test). Consider `ScriptComposer` / multi-call approaches only after you understand entry functions. ([aptos.dev][2], [Medium][4])

### Runnable example — _Hello Blockchain module + script_

**Move version used for examples:** **Move 2** (Aptos toolchain default from CLI v6.x onward). Compiler info: Aptos Move Compiler v2. ([aptos.dev][5])

**Package layout**

```
my_move_pkg/
  Move.toml
  sources/
    hello.move
    run_hello.move
```

**`sources/hello.move`**

```move
address 0xYOUR_ADDRESS {
  module Hello {
    public fun set_message(account: &signer, msg: vector<u8>) {
      // store a message as a resource under account
      let m = Message { val: msg };
      move_to(account, m);
    }

    public entry fun get_message(addr: address): vector<u8> acquires Message {
      let m = borrow_global<Message>(addr);
      m.val
    }

    struct Message has key {
      val: vector<u8>
    }
  }
}
```

**`sources/run_hello.move` (script)**

```move
script {
  use 0xYOUR_ADDRESS::Hello;
  use std::signer;
  fun main(caller: &signer) {
    Hello::set_message(caller, b"hi, aptos!".to_vec());
  }
}
```

**Compile & run locally (devnet/local):**

1. Create `Move.toml` with `named_addresses = { YOUR_ADDRESS = "default" }` (or replace `0xYOUR_ADDRESS` with `default` and pass `--named-addresses YOUR_ADDRESS=default`).
2. Compile:

   ```bash
   aptos move compile --package-dir ./my_move_pkg
   ```

3. Run script (on localnet or devnet; ensure `aptos` CLI profile points to network and you have a funded account):

   ```bash
   aptos move run-script --package-dir ./my_move_pkg --script-path sources/run_hello.move --named-addresses "YOUR_ADDRESS=0x..."`
   ```

(If you prefer the single-step: `aptos move run-script --script-path ...` — see CLI docs for pros/cons.) ([aptos.dev][3])

### Exercises (with answers)

1. **Exercise:** Write a `counter` module with `increment` and `get` functions storing a `Counter` resource under signer.
   **Answer summary:** Use `struct Counter has key { value: u64 }`, `move_to` on creation, `borrow_global_mut<Counter>(signer.address)` to increment, and `borrow_global<Counter>` to get the value. Remember `acquires Counter` on any function using `move_from` / `move_to`.
2. **Exercise:** Why must resources have `has key` to be stored in global storage?
   **Answer:** The `has key` ability marks the struct as storable under an address (global storage). Without `key`, `move_to` and related global ops are illegal.
3. **Exercise:** Show how to add a unit test for `increment`.
   **Answer summary:** Add `#[test] fun test_increment() { let acct = @0x1; /* create counter */; Counter::increment(&signer::spec_signer()); assert!(...); }` — use `#[test]` annotation; run `aptos move test`.

### TL;DR cheat-sheet (2–6 bullets)

- Modules = deployed libraries; Scripts = transaction entrypoints.
- `aptos move compile` → `build/` artifacts; `aptos move run-script` to run scripts. ([aptos.dev][3])
- Use `acquires<T>` for functions accessing global resources.
- Use `named_addresses` in `Move.toml` or CLI flags to satisfy `address` placeholders.

**Recommended learning path (this topic)**
Beginner: write a script and compile it → Intermediate: publish a simple module and call it from a script → Advanced: structure a multi-file package with named addresses and unit tests.

---

# 2. Types (Tag: **Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced**)

**Goal:** Enumerate Move’s core types, rules (copyability/drop), and how to use them safely.

### Beginner explanation (conceptual)

Move has a small but expressive type system: integers (multiple widths), `bool`, `address`, `vector<T>`, `signer`, references (`&T`, `&mut T`), structs, and resource types. Each type carries _abilities_ (e.g., `copy`, `drop`, `store`, `key`) which affect how values of that type may be used. Understanding primitive types and abilities is essential for safe Move code. ([aptos.dev][6], [Move Language][7])

### Intermediate detail (rules, syntax, examples)

- **Integer types:** `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `u256`. Comparison ops only work on integers; casts are explicit and abort on overflow. Division truncates (rounds down). ([aptos.dev][6])
- **Bool & Address:** `bool` is `true|false`. `address` is a 16-byte account address.
- **Vectors:** `vector<T>` is the only collection primitive. `vector<u8>` is common for byte arrays (strings). Use `push_back`, `pop_back`, `length`, and `borrow`. Literals have `b"..."` syntax for `vector<u8>`. ([aptos.dev][8], [Move Language][9])
- **Signer:** `signer` is a special capability-type used to prove caller identity; it cannot be forged and is used to call `move_to` or other account-scoped operations.
- **References:** `&T` (immutable) and `&mut T` (mutable). References cannot be stored in global storage (only values).
- **Abilities:** types/structs declare abilities via `has` list: `struct S has key, store { ... }`. Abilities control whether a struct can be stored in global storage (`key`), copied (`copy`), or dropped (`drop`). Missing abilities can produce compile errors. ([Move Book][10])

### Advanced notes / common pitfalls / design patterns

- **Precision & overflow:** integers are unsigned and casts abort if the value can’t fit — design arithmetic to avoid surprising aborts. Watch ordering of operations to reduce rounding errors from integer division. ([aptos.dev][6])
- **Vectors of resources:** `vector<T>` can hold non-resource types and resources depending on context, but you must respect move semantics — pushing a `resource` into a vector moves ownership.
- **Phantom / generic type parameters:** sometimes you declare `struct Wrapper<T> has copy { v: u64 }` to parameterize logic — but ability combinations can limit what `T` can be used (e.g., if you require `key` ability for `T`, indicate that in docs / specs).

### Runnable example — Type idioms

**`sources/types_example.move`**

```move
address 0x1 {
  module TypesExample {
    struct Counter has key {
      value: u64
    }

    public fun new_counter(account: &signer) {
      let c = Counter { value: 0u64 };
      move_to(account, c);
    }

    public fun inc(account: &signer) acquires Counter {
      let c_ref = borrow_global_mut<Counter>(signer::address_of(account));
      c_ref.value = c_ref.value + 1;
    }

    public fun push_bytes(v: vector<u8>): u64 {
      vector::length(&v) // note: borrow semantics
    }
  }
}
```

**Compile / test:** `aptos move compile` and `aptos move test` in package dir.

### Exercises (with answers)

1. **Exercise:** What ability set is needed for a struct stored under an address?
   **Answer:** `has key` (to be stored in global storage), optionally `store`/`drop`/`copy` depending on behavior.
2. **Exercise:** Does `vector<u8>` support literal `b"hello"`?
   **Answer:** Yes — `b"hello"` is a `vector<u8>` literal. ([aptos.dev][8])
3. **Exercise (advanced):** If `struct S has copy`, what are the dangers?
   **Answer:** `copy` allows implicit duplication of values — not suitable for asset-like structs. `copy` on a type that wraps ownership-bearing fields can cause logic errors or double-spend patterns; use `copy` only for trivially copyable data.

### TL;DR cheat-sheet

- Integers: `u8..u256`, casts abort on overflow; division truncates. ([aptos.dev][6])
- `vector<T>` is the collection primitive; `vector<u8>` for bytes. ([Move Language][9])
- `signer` proves transaction origin; `address` is the canonical account id.
- Abilities (`copy`, `drop`, `store`, `key`) determine valid operations.

**Recommended learning path (this topic)**
Beginner: use `u64`, `bool`, `address`, `vector<u8>` in toy modules → Intermediate: write structs with `has key` and use `move_to`/`borrow_global` → Advanced: reason about abilities and generics & test edge cases for arithmetic and vector mutation.

---

# 3. Resources & Structs (Tag: **Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced**)

**Goal:** Teach how to model on-chain assets using Move `struct`s and resource semantics, explain `has` abilities, and global storage ops.

### Beginner explanation (conceptual)

A **resource** in Move is simply a struct with restrictions: it cannot be copied or implicitly dropped, and ownership must be explicitly transferred. Resources are the primary building blocks for on-chain assets (tokens, vaults, NFTs). In Move you declare these with `struct Name has key { ... }` (adding other abilities as appropriate). Resources are stored in global storage at account addresses and manipulated with `move_to`, `move_from`, `borrow_global`, etc. ([Move Language][7], [move-developers-dao.gitbook.io][11])

### Intermediate detail (rules, syntax, examples)

- **Declaring a resource:**

```move
struct MyToken has key {
  supply: u128,
  owner: address
}
```

- **Global storage ops:**

  - `move_to<T>(signer, value)` — publishes `T` under the signer's address (requires `has key` for `T`).
  - `move_from<T>(addr): T` — removes and returns `T` from `addr` (aborts if not present).
  - `borrow_global<T>(addr): &T` / `borrow_global_mut<T>(addr): &mut T` — borrow references to on-chain resources.

- **`acquires` annotation:** Functions that call `move_from`, `borrow_global`, or `move_to` on a resource type `T` must include `acquires T` in the signature. This is a compiler-level declaration of which global types a function may access. Omitting it produces compilation failure. ([move-developers-dao.gitbook.io][11])

- **Struct abilities & design:**

  - `has key` — allowed in global storage.
  - `has store` — allows the struct to be stored in `vector<T>` or fields of other structs.
  - `has copy` / `has drop` — control copy/drop semantics; resources typically **do not** have `copy` or `drop`.

- **Nested resources & collections:** You can represent collections like an NFT collection by having a parent resource holding `vector<T>` of child resource ids (or by using an object model pattern). When transferring the parent, implement explicit logic to move child resources or to transfer pointers/ownership. (More on object model later.) ([GitHub][12])

### Advanced notes / common pitfalls / design patterns

- **Atomic transfers:** If you need a transfer that moves multiple resources atomically, implement a single entry function that moves them together within one transaction. This avoids partial-transfer states.
- **Use `acquires` conservatively:** Overly broad `acquires` lists can reduce readability and increase the chance of accidental state changes. List only the resource types you need.
- **Avoid storing references in global storage:** references (`&T`) are ephemeral and cannot be persisted globally; always store owned values (structs, primitives, vectors).
- **Design pattern — resource factories & capabilities:** Use factory patterns for minting (privileged module that can `move_to` a resource) and capability resources (capability types that gate privileged actions). Example: keep a `MintCapability` resource only in admin account; functions require `&MintCapability` to mint tokens.

### Runnable example — simple ERC20-like resource (Aptos-style coin simplified)

**`sources/simple_coin.move`**

```move
address 0xCOIN {
  module SimpleCoin {
    use std::signer;

    // A coin balance resource stored under each account that holds coins.
    struct Balance has key {
      value: u64
    }

    // Admin-only minter cap (example)
    struct MinterCap has key { }

    public fun initialize(admin: &signer) {
      // publish a minter cap under admin to allow minting
      move_to(admin, MinterCap {});
    }

    public fun mint(admin: &signer, recipient: address, amount: u64) acquires MinterCap, Balance {
      // check admin has minter cap
      let _cap = borrow_global<MinterCap>(signer::address_of(admin));
      // deposit into recipient's Balance or create it
      if (!exists<Balance>(recipient)) {
        // create balance under recipient (requires a signer for that address in real flows)
        // (For demo: assume recipient is admin or we use helper script)
      } else {
        let b = borrow_global_mut<Balance>(recipient);
        b.value = b.value + amount;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Notes:** Real Aptos coin implementation is more nuanced — this example shows common patterns (mint cap, Balance resource, `acquires`). See Aptos coin / FA docs for production-ready implementations. ([aptos.dev][1])

**Compile & test:** `aptos move compile` → `aptos move test` (write `#[test]` functions to exercise `mint` flows).

### Exercises (with answers)

1. **Exercise:** Implement `transfer` that moves `amount` from `from`'s `Balance` to `to`'s `Balance` atomically. Which operations and annotations are required?
   **Answer summary:** Use a `public entry fun transfer(from: &signer, to: address, amount: u64) acquires Balance { let from_addr = signer::address_of(from); let mut bal_from = borrow_global_mut<Balance>(from_addr); assert!(bal_from.value >= amount); bal_from.value = bal_from.value - amount; if (!exists<Balance>(to)) { /* create balance for to */ } let bal_to = borrow_global_mut<Balance>(to); bal_to.value = bal_to.value + amount; }` — ensure `acquires Balance`.
2. **Exercise:** What happens if you `move_from<T>` when `T` does not exist at that address?
   **Answer:** The transaction aborts (runtime abort). Use `exists<T>(addr)` to guard.
3. **Exercise:** How to prevent arbitrary accounts from minting?
   **Answer:** Use capability resources stored only under admin addresses; mint functions check for the capability presence.

### TL;DR cheat-sheet

- Resources = structs with restricted abilities (no implicit copy/drop). Use `has key` to store under addresses. ([Move Language][7])
- Global ops: `move_to`, `move_from`, `borrow_global(_mut)`, `exists<T>(addr)`.
- `acquires<T>` must be present on functions interacting with global `T`. ([move-developers-dao.gitbook.io][11])

**Recommended learning path (this topic)**
Beginner: define simple `struct` resources & use `move_to`/`borrow_global` → Intermediate: implement token-like `Balance` and safe `transfer` with checks → Advanced: implement capabilities, factory patterns, nested resources and atomic multi-resource transfers.

# 4. Struct Abilities (`copy`, `drop`, `store`, `key`)

**Tag:** Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced
**Goal:** Understand Move _abilities_, how to declare them on `struct`s, and how they affect storage, copying and dropping semantics.

### Beginner explanation

Abilities are properties attached to types and structs that determine what operations are allowed (copying, dropping, storing in global storage, using as keys). The four canonical abilities are: `copy`, `drop`, `store`, `key`. `resource` semantics rely on controlling these abilities: resources typically **do not** have `copy` or `drop`. ([Aptos][2])

### Intermediate detail

- Syntax: `struct My has key, store { ... }`
- Meaning:

  - `copy`: values can be bitwise-copied (like primitives). Avoid for asset-bearing structs.
  - `drop`: values can be implicitly dropped (allowing function exit to discard them). If absent, you must explicitly return or move them.
  - `store`: allows the type to be stored in containers like `vector<T>` or fields of other structs.
  - `key`: allows the struct to be stored in global storage under an account address (used by `move_to`, `move_from`).

- The compiler enforces ability rules; ability inference for generics is performed and errors if mismatched.

### Advanced notes / common pitfalls / patterns

- Do **not** mark asset-bearing structs `copy` (double-spend risk).
- `drop` on a struct that manages external invariants can allow accidental resource loss — generally avoid `drop` unless you know the consequence.
- Use `store` when you need to hold values in vectors; but be careful: storing `resource` inside `vector` may complicate moves and borrows.
- Abilities interact with generics: generic parameters can require certain abilities (e.g., `T: key`) enforced via `acquires` and type constraints.

### Runnable example

```move
address 0x1 {
  module AbilitiesExample {
    struct Trivial has copy, drop {
      x: u8
    }

    struct Keyed has key {
      owner: address,
      balance: u64
    }
  }
}
```

**Compile:** `aptos move compile` (Move 2 / Aptos toolchain). ([Aptos][3])

### Exercises

1. Q: Why should a token `Balance` NOT have `copy`?
   A: `copy` allows duplication of balances leading to double-counting; asset types must be non-copyable.
2. Q: When do you need `store`?
   A: When T appears as `vector<T>` element or a field in another struct that is storable.

### TL;DR

- `key` → stored under addresses. `store` → storable in containers. `copy` & `drop` control duplication & drop semantics. Avoid `copy` for assets.

**Recommended learning path:** Start with examples of `has key` (Resources), then experiment adding/removing `copy`/`drop` to see compile errors.

(References: Move Reference — Abilities.) ([Aptos][2])

# 5. Modules (design, publishing, named addresses)

**Tag:** Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced
**Goal:** Learn how to design modules, use named addresses, publish modules to Aptos networks and manage upgrades.

### Beginner explanation

Modules are Move’s compiled units — they contain struct and function definitions and are published to addresses on-chain. Use `address 0x... { module M { ... } }` or named addresses via `Move.toml`. Publishing is done via the Aptos CLI. ([Aptos][4])

### Intermediate detail

- **Package layout:** `Move.toml` configures named addresses and package metadata. Use `named_addresses` to map symbolic names to concrete addresses (helps tests and local dev).
- **Visibility:** `public` functions and struct fields control cross-module access. `friend`-style semantics do not exist; access is controlled by public/private.
- **Publishing:** `aptos move publish --package-dir . --profile <profile>` publishes compiled modules to network address configured in CLI profile. Ensure the publishing account has authority for the module address (i.e., the account equals the named address or a resource with module upgrade capability). ([Aptos][4])

### Advanced notes / module upgrade patterns

- Aptos supports module upgrade if publishing account controls the address and upgrade is allowed (some frameworks protect core modules). Use versioning in package management and migration scripts to transition storage layouts. Keep storage-compatible migrations (add fields at end, use wrapper types) to avoid corrupting on-chain state.
- Consider long-term governance: treat module upgrade as privileged action; manage via multisig or on-chain governance modules. ([Aptos][5])

### Runnable example — Publish flow

1. `Move.toml` with `named_addresses = { MyAddr = "default" }` and `sources/mymod.move` using `address MyAddr { module ... }`.
2. Compile: `aptos move compile --package-dir .`
3. Publish: `aptos move publish --package-dir . --profile devnet` (ensure devnet profile points to funded account). ([Aptos][4])

### Exercises

1. Q: How to fix compile error when module uses `0xMyAddr` literal but name not defined?
   A: Add `named_addresses` in `Move.toml` or use literal hex address.
2. Q: What to check before upgrading a module that has resources?
   A: Storage layout compatibility; migration functions; test upgrade path on testnet.

### TL;DR

- Modules = deployable libraries; use `Move.toml` for named addresses. Use `aptos move publish` to deploy. Plan upgrades with migrations and governance controls.

(References: Your First Move Module, Compile/Publish docs.) ([Aptos][4])

# 6. Scripts & Transactions (entry functions, scripts)

**Tag:** Beginner → Intermediate
**Goal:** Know how to write and run transaction scripts, how `entry` functions work and how scripts are invoked through CLI/SDKs.

### Beginner explanation

Scripts are one-off transaction entrypoints (or transaction functions inside modules marked `public entry`). A script executed in a transaction can accept `&signer` arguments to prove the caller. Use CLI or SDKs to publish and execute. ([Aptos][6])

### Intermediate detail

- **Two forms:** `script { ... }` source files compiled into entrypoints, and `public entry` functions inside modules callable via script or transaction payloads.
- **Signer:** `main(caller: &signer)` is common pattern — use `signer::address_of` to get address.
- **CLI run:** `aptos move run-script --script-path sources/script.move --named-addresses ...` or compile then run compiled script. Use SDKs (Rust/Python/JS) to build transaction payloads.

### Advanced notes

- Use `acquires` on entry functions that access global resources. For multi-signature transactions, scripts call modules that validate aggregated signatures. Use `ScriptComposer` or SDK transaction builders for complex multi-step flows. ([Aptos][5])

### Runnable example (script)

`script { use 0xMyAddr::MyModule; fun main(s: &signer) { MyModule::do_something(s) } }`
Run: `aptos move run-script --script-path sources/my_script.move --named-addresses MyAddr=0x...` ([Aptos][6])

### Exercises

1. Q: Difference between `public` and `public entry`?
   A: `public` is callable by modules; `public entry` is callable as a transaction entrypoint (and takes `&signer` typically).
2. Q: How to send a transaction from SDK?
   A: Build payload (script or module function) and submit with signed transaction using SDK (see Aptos SDK docs).

### TL;DR

- Scripts = transaction payloads; `public entry` functions are transaction-callable functions. Use CLI/SDK to run.

(References: Compiling Scripts, Your First Move Module.) ([Aptos][6])

# 7. Object model (collections, nested NFTs, Collection NFT patterns)

**Tag:** Intermediate → Advanced
**Goal:** Explain object/collection patterns — how to represent collections that own other NFTs (nested objects), transfer semantics and querying.

### Beginner explanation

A collection is usually modeled via a resource (struct with `has key`) that contains references or handles to child NFTs (either by holding children directly as resources or storing identifiers/handles). Transferring a parent collection can be implemented to transfer children automatically. ([Aptos][1])

### Intermediate detail

- **Patterns:**

  - **Direct ownership:** Parent resource contains `vector<Child>` (child resource types must have `store` ability if stored in vector). Moving the parent moves children.
  - **Index-based:** Parent stores identifiers (IDs) of child NFTs; a registry maps IDs to owners. Transfer parent implies loop transferring or reassigning ownership for each child.
  - **Object abstraction:** Aptos often uses object patterns where objects are separate resources with ownership linked via address or object id. Querying tools (indexer/REST API) can show nested ownership if the application stores children under parent's address or stores mapping.

- **`acquires` and `exists`:** Use `acquires Child` and `exists<Child>(addr)` checks in functions that manipulate children.

### Advanced notes / pitfalls / design patterns

- **Atomic semantics:** If you want transferring a collection to atomically move all children, implement a single `entry` that `move_from` parent and children and `move_to` them under new owner. If children are numerous, gas may be a problem — consider representing children by references or off-chain indexing and performing batched moves.
- **Queryability:** The on-chain data model determines how easy it is for indexers to show ownership. If children are stored inside parent as `vector<Child>`, indexers may still need to parse module storage to present nested lists. Use explicit registry resources to simplify queries.

### Runnable example — Collection owning children (simplified)

```move
address 0xC {
  module Gallery {
    struct NFT has key, store { id: u64, meta: vector<u8> }
    struct Collection has key {
      name: vector<u8>,
      children: vector<NFT> // requires NFT has store
    }

    public entry fun create_collection(owner: &signer, name: vector<u8>) {
      move_to(owner, Collection { name, children: vector::empty<NFT>() });
    }

    public entry fun add_child(owner: &signer, child: NFT) acquires Collection {
      let addr = signer::address_of(owner);
      let c = borrow_global_mut<Collection>(addr);
      vector::push_back(&mut c.children, child);
    }

    public entry fun transfer_collection(owner: &signer, new_owner: address) acquires Collection {
      let addr = signer::address_of(owner);
      let col = move_from<Collection>(addr); // moves collection & children
      move_to(&signer::borrow_signer(new_owner), col); // pseudo: for demo — in practice need signer for new_owner
    }
  }
}
```

Notes: transferring to arbitrary `new_owner` requires that you have permission to create resources under `new_owner`—typical pattern: `transfer_collection` is `entry` called by current owner but to move to `new_owner` you may need the receiver to accept or have an off-chain signature; implement via escrow patterns. See Advanced notes above.

### Exercises

1. Implement `list_children(collection_addr)` to return children metadata (hint: borrow_global<Collection>).
   **Answer:** `let c = borrow_global<Collection>(collection_addr); // iterate vector::length / borrow`
2. How do you ensure transferring parent automatically updates child owner references?
   **Answer:** Store owner address inside child metadata and update it in the same transaction when moving child resources.

### TL;DR

- Model collection as a resource with `vector` of children (requires `store`) or as mapping of IDs. To transfer parent with children atomically, move them together in one transaction.

(References: Move Book patterns; storage & vector docs.) ([Aptos][1])

# 8. Events (EventHandle & module events)

**Tag:** Beginner → Intermediate
**Goal:** Use Aptos event systems (modern Module Events) to emit and read events, know patterns for indexing.

### Beginner explanation

Events allow modules to emit structured logs during transactions. Aptos supports modern module events (recommended) and older `EventHandle` patterns. Events are stored in event stores per account and are retrievable via indexer/REST endpoints. ([Aptos][7])

### Intermediate detail

- **Define:** Use `struct MyEvent { field: T }` and a publisher resource with `EventHandle<MyEvent>` type to emit events.
- **Emit:** `event::emit_event(&mut handle, MyEvent { ... })` (API via event module in std).
- **Read:** Off-chain indexer/REST API exposes events; on-chain modules do not iterate event stores. Use sequence numbers and keys for continuity.

### Advanced notes

- Watch gas — events add storage and reading off-chain depends on indexer. Use events for audit/logging rather than essential state (store authoritative state on-chain). ([Aptos][8])

### Runnable example

```move
use std::event;
struct MintEvent has copy, drop { to: address, amount: u64 }

struct EventStore has key {
  handle: event::EventHandle<MintEvent>,
}

public entry fun init_store(account: &signer) {
  move_to(account, EventStore { handle: event::new_event_handle<MintEvent>(account) });
}

public entry fun mint_and_emit(account: &signer, to: address, amount: u64) acquires EventStore {
  let store = borrow_global_mut<EventStore>(signer::address_of(account));
  event::emit_event(&mut store.handle, MintEvent { to, amount });
}
```

Run by compiling and calling via `aptos move run-script` or module `entry` calls. ([Aptos][8])

### Exercises

1. Q: Are events guaranteed to be delivered?
   A: Events in block are emitted deterministically with transaction; off-chain delivery depends on indexer; they are on-chain logs retrievable if indexer runs.

### TL;DR

- Use `event::new_event_handle` + `event::emit_event` for module events; prefer module events over legacy EventHandle where possible.

(References: Events docs.) ([Aptos][7])

---

# 9. Ownership & Capabilities (signer, capabilities, access control)

**Tag:** Beginner → Advanced
**Goal:** Model and enforce access control using `signer`, resources as capabilities, and ownership checks.

### Beginner explanation

`&signer` proves transaction origin. Capabilities are resources that gate privileged actions (e.g., `MintCapability` stored only at admin). Access control = check signer address or require capability resource. ([Aptos][2])

### Intermediate detail

- **Patterns:**

  - `require_admin(s: &signer)` checks `signer::address_of(s) == ADMIN_ADDR`.
  - Capability resource: `struct MinterCap has key {}` stored under admin; functions `acquires MinterCap` and call `borrow_global<MinterCap>(admin_addr)` to verify.
  - Use `has key` on capability resource; do not expose capability to untrusted code.

### Advanced notes

- Use capability delegation patterns: admin can create ephemeral capabilities for specific tasks and revoke them by moving the resource. Store auditing info with capability creation/transfer. Avoid granting raw signer handles to modules; use authorization resources.

### Runnable example (Mint capability)

See SimpleCoin `MinterCap` earlier (Resources section). Use `exists<MinterCap>(addr)` to check.

### Exercises

1. Implement `revoke_minter(admin: &signer)` that removes `MinterCap`.
   **Answer:** `move_from<MinterCap>(signer::address_of(admin));` — guard with `assert!(exists<MinterCap>(admin_addr))`.

### TL;DR

- Use `&signer` to prove caller; use dedicated capability resources for privileged ops.

(References: Move Book / resources & capabilities.) ([Aptos][1])

---

# 10. Generics & Phantom types

**Tag:** Intermediate → Advanced
**Goal:** Learn to write generic modules and use phantom types to capture compile-time info without runtime cost.

### Beginner explanation

Generics allow modules and structs to be parameterized by types. Phantom types are generic parameters not used at runtime but used to create type-safe distinctions. ([Aptos][2])

### Intermediate detail

- Syntax: `struct Box<T> has store { x: T }` or `struct Phantom<T> has copy { _marker: bool }` (use phantom patterns).
- For asset safety, generic constraints on abilities may be required; e.g., `T: key` (implicit via `acquires` etc.). Compiler will enforce ability compatibility.

### Advanced notes

- Use phantom types to create multiple token types sharing logic but prevented from interchanging — e.g., `struct Vault<TokenType> has key { balance: u128 }`. This creates compile-time separation of vaults for different tokens.

### Runnable example

```move
struct Vault<Token> has key { balance: u64 }
public entry fun deposit<Token>(acct: &signer, amount: u64) acquires Vault<Token> { /* ... */ }
```

### Exercises

1. Q: How to enforce that `Token` is `key`?
   A: Use `acquires Vault<Token>`; if Vault<Token> requires `key` then `Token` must meet abilities (compiler will inform).

### TL;DR

- Generics add type safety — use phantom/generic token types to avoid mixing token audiences.

(Reference: Move Reference — Generics.) ([Aptos][2])

---

# 11. Error Handling (aborts, codes, patterns)

**Tag:** Beginner → Intermediate
**Goal:** Learn Move abort semantics, error codes, `assert!` patterns and safe failure modes.

### Beginner explanation

Move uses `abort` with numeric codes to signal transaction failure. `assert!(cond, code)` is commonly used; code numbers map to reason. Use consistent error code scheme and document codes. ([Aptos][2])

### Intermediate detail

- Use `assert!(cond, ERROR_CODE)` or `abort ERROR_CODE` for early exits.
- Design patterns: reserve ranges (e.g., 1–999 for core module, 1000–1999 for auth errors), create constants `const E_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE: u64 = 1001;` for readability.

### Advanced notes

- Avoid exposing raw abort codes to users without descriptive off-chain mapping. Link aborts to diagnostics in UIs and indexers.

### Runnable example

```move
const E_NOT_OWNER: u64 = 0x1;

public entry fun withdraw(owner: &signer, amount: u64) acquires Balance {
  let addr = signer::address_of(owner);
  let b = borrow_global_mut<Balance>(addr);
  assert!(b.value >= amount, E_NOT_OWNER);
  b.value = b.value - amount;
}
```

### Exercises

1. Q: When should you use `abort` vs `assert!`?
   A: `assert!` is a convenience with code; `abort` is explicit. Both produce same runtime abort; prefer `assert!` for readability.

### TL;DR

- Use numeric error codes, define constants, and keep consistent ranges.

(Reference: Move Reference — Abort & Assert.) ([Aptos][2])

---

# 12. Accounts & Addresses (auth key model, rotation)

**Tag:** Intermediate → Advanced
**Goal:** Explain Aptos account/address model, authentication key rotation, and flows to update keys.

### Beginner explanation

An Aptos account has an address and an _authentication key_ used to verify transaction signatures. Aptos supports rotation of authentication keys (changing which key can sign transactions for the same address) without recreating accounts. This enables key rotation and multi-sig authentication schemes. ([Aptos Forum][9], [Aptos][3])

### Intermediate detail

- **Auth key rotation:** The account owner submits a transaction that updates the on-chain authentication key configuration. This can be done via CLI/SDK flows that construct the transaction to change keys. Aptos docs and tutorial threads explain best practices. ([Aptos Forum][9], [DEV Community][10])
- **Multi-agent txs vs multisig accounts:** There are different approaches: use an on-chain multisig account (contract-managed) or multi-agent transactions (several signers sign a single transaction payload). Aptos supports both patterns.

### Advanced notes / pitfalls

- Rotate keys in a secure environment and coordinate updates with off-chain clients and indexers. If you lose all keys and have no recovery, account funds may be inaccessible. Manage backups and guardian keys carefully. Use multisig or recovery modules for higher security.

### Runnable flow (high-level)

- Using `aptos` CLI or SDK, create rotation transaction payload updating the `AuthenticationKey` resource or calling the aptos-framework helper functions. See Aptos docs for the latest CLI flags and SDK helpers. ([Aptos Forum][9], [DEV Community][10])

### Exercises

1. Q: Can you change an account address?
   A: No — address is fixed; you change authentication key (which controls who can sign) but not the address.

### TL;DR

- Auth keys rotate to change signers while preserving address. Use secure CLI/SDK flows and guard key backups.

(References: Aptos key rotation docs and forum guides.) ([Aptos Forum][9], [DEV Community][10])

# 13. Coin / FA standards (Aptos Coin → FA standard migration)

**Tag:** Intermediate → Advanced
**Goal:** Understand Aptos coin standard(s): legacy `coin` module and the new FA (Fungible Asset) standard migration.

### Beginner explanation

Aptos provides a `Coin` standard for fungible tokens; recently there’s been a migration path to a newer FA standard for fungible assets. The standard defines types and helper modules for minting, transferring and metadata. ([Aptos][11])

### Intermediate detail

- **Coin module:** `0x1::coin` provides standard coin primitives. Token creators create a type implementing the `Coin` interface.
- **FA migration:** Aptos Foundation has published migration notes and is migrating existing coins to FA standard to unify token handling. Read migration docs for impact on custom tokens. ([Aptos][12], [Aptos][13])

### Advanced notes

- When building tokens, follow the official coin/FA patterns for compatibility with wallets, faucets and DEXes. Ensure metadata and decimals fields are consistent with ecosystem expectations.

### Runnable example

- Use `aptos-framework` token templates or reference the `0x1::coin` example code to implement a new coin type. Test locally and on testnet; run `aptos move test`. ([Aptos][11])

### Exercises

1. Q: Does migration to FA require user action for all tokens?
   A: Official migration messages indicate many tokens migrate automatically; consult current migration docs/announcements for exact behavior. ([Aptos][12])

### TL;DR

- Use Aptos `coin` or FA spec; follow the standard for compatibility. Check migration docs for token-specific guidance.

(References: Aptos coin standard and FA migration.) ([Aptos][11], [Aptos][12])

---

# 14. Storage patterns (`move_to`,`move_from`, `acquires`)

**Tag:** Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced
**Goal:** Use global storage ops safely (publish, remove, borrow) and understand `acquires` annotations.

### Beginner explanation

Move global storage APIs: `move_to`, `move_from`, `borrow_global`, `borrow_global_mut`, and `exists`. `acquires<T>` declares the resource types a function may access in global storage. Compiler checks `acquires` usage. ([Aptos][2])

### Intermediate detail

- **Common patterns:** account-owned resource (publish under signer), registries storing mappings or vectors, factory patterns (minting resources for other accounts), vaults.
- **`acquires`:** Required on functions that call `move_from`/`borrow_global` on a resource type. Helps static analysis and Move Prover.

### Advanced notes

- Avoid deep nested `move_from` chains without `acquires` declarations; they complicate verification. For upgradeability, choose migration-friendly storage layouts: prefer adding new resources rather than modifying existing struct layouts when possible.

### Runnable example

See earlier `SimpleCoin` and `Gallery` examples (Resource & Object model sections). Compile & test with `aptos move compile` and `aptos move test`.

### Exercises

1. Q: What happens if `acquires` is missing?
   A: Compile-time error; the compiler enforces `acquires`.
2. Q: How to check if a resource exists at `addr`?
   A: `exists<T>(addr)`.

### TL;DR

- Use `move_to`/`move_from` for moving resources; annotate functions with `acquires` for any global resource access.

(References: Move Reference — Storage ops.) ([Aptos][2])

---

# 15. Security Best Practices (reentrancy, integer safety, invariants)

**Tag:** Intermediate → Advanced
**Goal:** Defensive rules and patterns to avoid common smart-contract vulnerabilities.

### Beginner explanation

Write checks for invariants, validate inputs, avoid unsafe `copy`/`drop`, and ensure operations are atomic where necessary. Use `assert!` for sanity checks. ([Aptos][2])

### Intermediate detail / best practices

- **Input validation:** Validate signer addresses, range checks, and vector bounds.
- **Numeric safety:** Use `checked` style or explicit aborts on overflow; integer casts abort on overflow by design.
- **Reentrancy:** Move’s resource model reduces reentrancy vectors but be mindful when calling out to other modules that may call back; design functions that update state before external calls.
- **Least privilege:** Use capability resources for privileged actions; use multisig for high-value operations.
- **Testing & proofs:** Use Move Prover to formally assert invariants. ([Aptos][14])

### Advanced notes

- Auditing: review `acquires` lists, ensure no unauthorized global access; use the Move Prover for exhaustive checks of key invariants (e.g., token supply never exceeds cap). Integrate contract tests with CI.

### Runnable checklist

- Add preconditions using `assert!` and write unit tests asserting invariants; run Move Prover for key modules. ([Aptos][14])

### Exercises

1. Q: How to prevent draining funds when transferring multiple resources?
   A: Implement atomic transfer in single `entry` function that checks all conditions and performs all moves without external calls in between.

### TL;DR

- Validate inputs, use capability-based access control, test and formally verify invariants where possible.

(References: Move Prover & security best practices.) ([Aptos][14])

---

# 16. Testing & Debugging (`aptos move test`, tracing)

**Tag:** Beginner → Intermediate
**Goal:** Use Move unit tests, CLI test runner and debugging techniques.

### Beginner explanation

Add `#[test]` functions in your Move modules to run unit tests; `aptos move test` executes tests locally. Use CLI logs and event emissions to inspect behavior. ([Aptos][4])

### Intermediate detail

- **Test annotations:** `#[test]` marks a function as unit test. Use `assert!` for conditions.
- **Localnet / devnet testing:** Use test profiles and local node for integration tests. Use CLI flags like `--package-dir` and `--named-addresses` to run tests.
- **Debugging:** Insert events or temporary storage writes to inspect runtime state. Use returned error codes for rapid diagnostics.

### Advanced notes

- Use Move Prover in addition to tests for exhaustive verification. Use fuzzing / property-based tests for corner cases and gas-based checks for cost-sensitive logic.

### Runnable commands

- `aptos move test --package-dir .`
- `aptos move compile` for compiling before running tests. ([Aptos][4])

### Exercises

1. Q: How to test a function that requires `acquires T`?
   A: In the test, set up the account with the resource T (e.g., `move_to`) then call the function in the test.

### TL;DR

- Use `#[test]` and `aptos move test` for unit tests; supplement with Move Prover and integration tests.

(References: Testing guides.) ([Aptos][4])

---

# 17. Aptos CLI & Toolchain (compile, publish, run)

**Tag:** Beginner → Intermediate
**Goal:** Practical CLI commands and patterns for compiling, publishing, running and managing Move packages using Aptos CLI.

### Beginner explanation

Install Aptos CLI (follow aptos.dev guide). Key commands: `aptos move compile`, `aptos move test`, `aptos move publish`, `aptos move run-script`. CLI profiles manage network endpoints and keys. ([Aptos][6])

### Intermediate detail / examples

- **Compile:** `aptos move compile --package-dir .`
- **Test:** `aptos move test --package-dir .`
- **Publish:** `aptos move publish --package-dir . --profile devnet`
- **Run script:** `aptos move run-script --script-path sources/script.move --named-addresses MyAddr=0x...`
- **Named addresses:** Place in `Move.toml` or pass `--named-addresses` flag. ([Aptos][6])

### Advanced notes

- Use CI integrations for automated builds and static checks; pin compiler versions to prevent toolchain drift.

### Exercises

1. Q: How to run a single test function?
   A: Use `aptos move test --package-dir . --test <test_name>` (check CLI help for exact flag support).

### TL;DR

- `aptos move compile` / `test` / `publish` / `run-script` are your main commands. Use `Move.toml` for named addresses.

(References: Aptos CLI docs.) ([Aptos][6])

---

# 18. Module Upgrades & Governance Patterns

**Tag:** Intermediate → Advanced
**Goal:** Manage module upgrades safely, plan migrations and combine governance patterns (multisig, on-chain DACs).

### Beginner explanation

Module upgrade is a privileged action. On Aptos, accounts that control module address can publish upgraded modules. Good governance requires multisig or DAO-managed authority to prevent unilateral upgrades. ([Aptos][5])

### Intermediate detail

- **Upgrade mechanics:** `aptos move publish` overwrites module bytecode at address; storage compatibility must be handled via migration functions.
- **Governance patterns:** On-chain multisig, timelock contracts, or DAO proposals can gate upgrades.

### Advanced notes

- Plan migrations: write migration functions to transform stored data; run migration in the same transaction as module upgrade if possible; test on testnets.

### Exercises

1. Q: How to add a field to struct safely?
   A: Add new resource type and migration path (avoid changing existing struct layout destructively).

### TL;DR

- Upgrades = powerful + dangerous. Use multisig governance and migration functions.

(References: Multisig & publish docs.) ([Aptos][5])

---

# 19. Provers (Move Prover & MSL)

**Tag:** Advanced
**Goal:** Apply the Move Prover and Move Specification Language (MSL) to formally verify invariants and properties of Move modules.

### Beginner explanation

Move Prover is a verification tool that checks MSL (specifications written alongside code) against Move modules to prove properties like invariants, absence of overflow, or supply preservation. Use it for high-value contracts. ([Aptos][14])

### Intermediate detail

- **MSL:** Write `spec` blocks and `invariant` annotations in modules. Example: `spec module { invariant[0] ... }`.
- **Running prover:** `aptos move prover` or `cargo` integration depending on environment; follow Move Prover guide for correct flags. ([Aptos][14])

### Advanced notes

- Model external effects conservatively; write modular specs. Prover may need loop invariants and helper lemmas for complex proofs. Integrate verification into CI to prevent regressions.

### Runnable example (very short spec)

```move
spec module {
  // example spec: total supply invariant etc.
}
```

Run Move Prover per docs. ([Aptos][14])

### Exercises

1. Q: What is the benefit of Move Prover over tests?
   A: Prover verifies correctness for all inputs and global states (exhaustive), while tests only check concrete cases.

### TL;DR

- Use Move Prover + MSL to formally verify module invariants; necessary for high-value protocols.

(References: Move Prover guide, MSL docs.) ([Aptos][14])

---

# 20. Authentication Key Rotation (CLI & SDK flows)

**Tag:** Intermediate → Advanced
**Goal:** Steps and caveats for rotating authentication keys safely for accounts on Aptos.

### Beginner explanation

Key rotation updates who can sign transactions for an account without changing the account address. It’s often used to replace compromised keys or upgrade to multisig. ([Aptos Forum][9])

### Intermediate detail

- **Mechanics:** Build and submit a rotation transaction (via CLI or SDK). Commonly you:

  1. Create new keypair(s).
  2. Construct rotation payload to replace auth key to new key(s) or multi-sig configuration.
  3. Sign with the _current_ key and submit.

- **Tools:** Aptos CLI and SDK tutorials provide sample flows; community guides outline safe practices like pre-authorizing other signing parties or using custodial recovery patterns. ([Aptos Forum][9], [DEV Community][10])

### Advanced notes

- Coordinate client updates: wallets, indexers and services must know the new key scheme if they maintain local signing logic. For multisig transitions, ensure quorum and replay-protection.

### Exercises

1. Q: Can key rotation be reverted?
   A: Yes, by submitting another rotation to previous key, but only if you still control the keys required to authorize such rotation.

### TL;DR

- Rotate auth keys by submitting a rotation transaction authenticated by current keys; plan multi-party coordination for multisig or guardian flows.

(References: Aptos key rotation forum & guides.) ([Aptos Forum][9], [DEV Community][10])

# 21. Multisig — Onchain Patterns & Tutorials

**Tag:** Intermediate → Advanced
**Goal:** Implement k-of-n multisig patterns, understand SDK examples, and use on-chain multisig account modules.

### Beginner explanation

Multisig requires multiple signers to approve a transaction. Aptos supports on-chain multisig account modules and SDK workflows to build multisig transactions. Tutorials show 2-of-3 examples. ([Aptos][15])

### Intermediate detail

- **Patterns:** Keep a multisig resource under an address that stores signers and threshold; create transaction proposal objects that collect partial signatures; execute when threshold reached.
- **SDK support:** Aptos Python/JS SDKs include helpers for building multisig or multi-agent transactions.

### Advanced notes

- Be careful with replay-protection and nonce management; ensure Off-chain coordination for signature collection is robust; consider timelocks and revocation policies.

### Runnable example & tutorial

- See "Your First Aptos Multisig" guide (Aptos docs) with code samples (Python SDK). Walkthrough includes creating key holders, configure multisig, fund, propose and execute. ([Aptos][15])

### Exercises

1. Q: What’s the difference between multi-agent tx and on-chain multisig?
   A: Multi-agent: multiple distinct signers sign a _single_ transaction that affects multiple accounts. On-chain multisig: an account uses on-chain module logic requiring multiple approvals to perform actions.

### TL;DR

- Use on-chain multisig modules for governance; use SDK examples for implementation; follow tutorials.

(References: Aptos multisig guides.) ([Aptos][15])

# 22. Advanced Topics (formal verification workflows, gas/optimizer notes, cross-module design, indexer integration)

**Tag:** Advanced
**Goal:** Cover advanced architecting patterns and developer tools for production systems.

### Beginner explanation

Advanced topics synthesize earlier sections — formal verification, gas optimization, cross-module decoupling, off-chain indexer integration (for queries), and full CI. ([Aptos][14])

### Intermediate detail & best practices

- **Formal verification workflow:** write specs, run Move Prover, fix invariants; integrate prover into CI. ([Aptos][14])
- **Gas & optimization:** Minimize vector ops and large loops; batch operations; avoid storing large data on-chain when possible.
- **Cross-module design:** Keep modules small and composable; publish core utilities in shared modules and keep business logic in modular units.
- **Indexer & off-chain queries:** Indexer must parse on-chain storage and events; design storage models friendly to indexers (explicit registries, easily parsed fields). ([Aptos][16])

### Runnable/operational checklist

- CI: compile, run tests, run prover, run static analysis, then publish to testnet.
- Monitoring: integrate event stream consumption and alerting for abort spikes or unusual transfers.

### Exercises

1. Q: How to scale NFT marketplaces on Aptos?
   A: Use minimal on-chain state for listings, put heavy metadata off-chain or in compact on-chain records, use indexing for UI.

### TL;DR

- Use Move Prover + robust tests; optimize gas by avoiding expensive ops; design storage for indexers.

(References: Move Prover, Aptos guides.) ([Aptos][14])

# 23. One-page Cheat-Sheet (compact)

- **Compile & Test:** `aptos move compile` / `aptos move test`. ([Aptos][6])
- **Publish:** `aptos move publish --package-dir . --profile <profile>`. ([Aptos][4])
- **Storage ops:** `move_to<T>(signer, v)`, `move_from<T>(addr)`, `borrow_global<T>(addr)`; annotate `acquires T`. ([Aptos][2])
- **Abilities:** `key` (global), `store` (container), `copy`, `drop` — avoid `copy` for assets. ([Aptos][2])
- **Events:** `event::new_event_handle` + `event::emit_event`. ([Aptos][8])
- **Prover:** Use Move Prover + MSL for invariants; integrate into CI. ([Aptos][14])
